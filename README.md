# NDS-Ironmon-Tracker: Animation Popout addition


This is a change to add the Animated Popout functionality to the existing BizHawk Ironmon Tracker on the main branch

**Warning: Party popout mode is known to crash BizHawk on repeated swapping of party members.
	Various resizing issues may be observed, particularly when swapping a larger pokemon with a smaller one.
 	Resizing issues can be rezolved by reloading the lua script, but a crash could cause lost progress.**

## Modes

- **Lead only**
